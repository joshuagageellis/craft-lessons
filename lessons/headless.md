# Headless w/ Craft and NextJS

## [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/)
> Craft is a flexible, user-friendly CMS for creating custom digital experiences on the web and beyond.
>
> It features:
>
> - An intuitive, user-friendly control panel for content creation and administrative tasks.
> - A clean-slate approach to content modeling and front-end development that doesnâ€™t make any assumptions about your content or how it should be consumed.
> - A built-in Plugin Store with hundreds of free and commercial plugins(opens new window), all just a click away.

In addition, Craft supports a headless approach, and has a [GraphQL API](https://craftcms.com/docs/4.x/graphql.html) that can be used to query content.

## [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
NextJS is a fullstack framework, utlizing file based routing, and react. It's a great framework for building static sites and is a great fit for Craft CMS.
